Figure \ref{fig:errors_sm} shows the distribution of roto-translation errors
(eq. (\ref{eq:rototranslation_error})) across $E$ experiments for CSM (red),
NDT (blue), and the proposed method of FSM (green).

  \caption{\small Distribution of mean errors of CSM (red), NDT (blue), and
           FSM (our approach) across a range of maximal positional and
           orientational displacements, for progressively larger sensor
           measurement noise levels. The variability of FSM's rigid body
           transformation error is consistent across all configurations. Its
           error is independent of the initial displacement of scans for a
           given level of sensor noise}

At small location and orientation displacements between the two input scans
($\overline{\delta}_{xy} \leq $ 0.05 m,
$\overline{\delta}_\theta \leq 2^\circ$), CSM outperforms NDT and FSM for low
levels of sensor noise ($\sigma_R \leq 0.01$ m). However, as noise increases,
FSM starts exhibiting greater robustness and accuracy than CSM. At greater
location and orientation displacements
($\overline{\delta}_{xy} > 0.05$ m, $\overline{\delta}_\theta > 2^\circ$), FSM
is able to maintain errors equal to or lower than CSM across the entirety of
the spectrum of tested noise levels. Compared to the equally
correspondenceless method of NDT, FSM exhibits greater accuracy across all
tested configurations. The magnitude and variability of FSM's errors for a
given level of sensor noise is independent of the displacement of the two input
scans (fig. \ref{fig:laser_odometry}). The juxtaposition of the three methods'
pose errors at high levels of sensor noise highlight the robustness afforded to
FSM by the Discrete Fourier transform and its properties. With regard to
orientation errors, $71.0\%$-$79.6\%$ of all final orientation errors resulted
under $\gamma / 2^{\nu_{\max}+1} = 0.0011$ rad when $\sigma_R = 0.0$ m. In terms
of execution time, CSM ranged from $4.8$ to $20.5$ ms, NDT from $8.1$ to $19.9$
ms, and FSM from $13.2$ to $16.7$ ms. Therefore FSM's exhibits the least
variability to sensor noise and locational and orientational displacement in
terms of runtime.  The measurement frequency of modern LIDAR sensors ranges
from $12$-$20$ Hz; therefore FSM runs in real time in modern processors.
