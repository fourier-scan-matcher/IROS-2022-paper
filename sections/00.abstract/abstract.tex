A real-time method for matching 2D range scans extracted from a LIDAR sensor
whose field of view is $2\pi$ is proposed. The method leverages properties of
the Fourier transform which arise due to the periodicity of the range signal.
The solution to scan-matching is given by transforming the problem into a
scan--to--map-scan matching problem. Matching is performed in a
correspondenceless manner. The proposed method outperforms established
scan-matching methods in terms of pose accuracy and robustness in tests on
public domain data and over sensor noise levels of commercially available range
sensors. The source code is available for download.
