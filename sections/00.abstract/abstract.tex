%A real-time method for matching 2D range scans extracted from a LIDAR sensor
%whose field of view is $2\pi$ is proposed. The method leverages properties of
%the Fourier transform which arise due to the periodicity of the range signal.
%The solution to scan-matching is given by transforming the problem into a
%scan--to--map-scan matching problem. Matching is performed in a
%correspondenceless manner. The proposed method outperforms established
%scan-matching methods in terms of pose accuracy and robustness in tests on
%public domain data and over sensor noise levels of commercially available range
%sensors. The source code is available for download.
In recent years affordable but noisier 2D range sensors with a field of view of
$2\pi$ have been introduced to the public. Scan-matching with these has been
insufficiently researched, while being a challenge due to their
increased measurement uncertainty. This paper proposes a real-time method for
matching scans extracted from panoramic 2D LIDAR sensors. The method leverages
properties of the Fourier transform which arise due to the periodicity of the
range signal. Matching is performed in a correspondenceless manner. The
proposed method outperforms established scan-matching methods in terms of pose
accuracy and robustness in tests on public domain data, and over noise
levels of commercially available sensors. The source code is available
for download.
