A real-time method for matching coplanar 2D range scans extracted from a LIDAR
sensor whose field of view is $2\pi$ is proposed. The method leverages
properties of the Fourier transform that arise due to the periodicity of the
range signal.  The solution to scan-matching is given by transforming the
problem into a scan--to--map-scan matching problem. Matching is performed in a
correspondenceless manner. The afforded robustness and the increased accuracy
compared to established scan-matching methods is exhibited through experiments
on public domain data. The source code is available for download.
