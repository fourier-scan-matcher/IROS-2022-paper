A method for matching coplanar 2D range scans extracted from a LIDAR sensor
whose field of view is $2\pi$ is proposed. The method exploits properties of
the Fourier transform that arise due to the periodicity of the range signal.
Matching is performed in a correspondenceless manner. The afforded robustness
and the increased accuracy compared to established scan-matcing methods is
exhibited through experiments. The source code is available for download.
