The panoramic 2D scan-matching problem is iteratively decomposed into two
disjunctive sub-problems. The first is estimating the relative orientation of
$\mathcal{S}_1$ with respect to $\mathcal{S}_0$ under the assumption that both
are captured from the same location. The second is estimating the relative
displacement of $\mathcal{S}_1$ with respect to $\mathcal{S}_0$ under the
assumption that both are captured from poses of the same orientation. Solving
the first sub-problem is followed by the solution to the second sub-problem.
This process is iterated until termination conditions are met.

The orientation and location estimation submethods are presented in subsections
\ref{subsec:method_orientation_correction} and
\ref{subsec:method_location_correction} respectively. Subsection
\ref{subsec:method_pose_correction} presents the method of how these two
are woven together into the system that solves Problem \ref{prob:the_problem}
that is proposed in this work.
