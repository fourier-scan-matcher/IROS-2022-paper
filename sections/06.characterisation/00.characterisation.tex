Figure \ref{fig:char_fsm_vs_FGI} depicts a comparison of FSM's alignment
process against that of an ICP variant, namely FastGICP, for measurement noise
with $\sigma_R = 0.03$ m. The top figure shows the initial configuration
between two scans captured from poses differing by $\bm{T} = (0.35 \text{m},
0.1 \text{m}, -60 \text{deg})$. While FastGICP progressively reduces the
orientation error, FSM nearly eliminates it in one step. From there it provides
finer approximations of the true orientation by increasing its angular sampling
degree, which in turn allow it to eliminate the positional errors further. The
CAER metric succeeds in navigating the error space better than FastGICP's
internal error metric, especially at such high orientational and positional
displacements. This fact makes FSM suitable in conditions of higher robot
velocities (here up to $4.2$ m/s and $720$ deg/s). FSM converges with an error
of $(0.0098 \text{m}, 0.08 \text{deg})$ in half as many iterations as FastGICP,
whose final error is $(0.61 \text{m}, 9.94 \text{deg})$.

Figure \ref{fig:char_max_range_test} shows the behaviour of FSM and an ICP
variant, namely, PLICP, in tests where the sensor's maximum range is limited.
Specifically, it shows their mean orientational and positional errors in ten
tests, for progressively smaller maximum sensor range, within the two
environments depicted in the top row with white colour. The sensor is affected
by noise of $\sigma_R = 0.05$ m. The sensor's first position is marked with a
blue dot. The maximum displacement between sensor poses is set to
$(\overline{\delta}_{xy}, \overline{\delta}_{\theta}) = (0.05 \text{m}, 10 \text{deg})$
and
$(\overline{\delta}_{xy}, \overline{\delta}_{\theta}) = (0.20 \text{m}, 45 \text{deg})$.
Altough one would expect that matching without the use of correspondences would
fare worse than matching with it, FSM exhibits more robust and more accurate
orientational errors than PLICP. In terms of position, FSM's errors are, on
the average, equal to or lower than those of PLICP.
