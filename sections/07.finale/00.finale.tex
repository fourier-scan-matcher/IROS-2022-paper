This paper has presented a scan-matching method for panoramic LIDAR sensors.
The approach rests on properties of the DFT, which afford it increased
robustness and accuracy compared to established scan-matching approaches in the
face of measurement noise exhibited by real-life sensors. The C++ code of the
proposed method, along with the implementation of the conducted experiments is
available at \url{}, .
