This paper has presented a real-time scan-matching method for panoramic 2D LIDAR
sensors. The approach rests on properties of the DFT, which afford it
increased robustness and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art scan-matching
approaches in the face of measurement noise exhibited by real-life sensors.
FSM does not rely on correspondences or features, and may operate under missing
range information; it is suitable for unstructured and outdoor environments,
even with high-frequency components.

Future work will focus on extending FSM to 3D LIDAR sensors, either by extension
to the slices not parallel to the ground, which may provide vertical motion
information according to the sine of each slice's pitch angle, or by
generalising its two main submethods to the 3D/6DOF space.

The C++ code of the proposed method, along with the implementation of the
conducted experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/li9i/fsm}.
