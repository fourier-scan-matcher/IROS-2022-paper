This paper has presented a scan-matching method for panoramic LIDAR sensors.
The approach rests on properties of the DFT, which afford it increased
robustness and accuracy compared to established scan-matching approaches in the
face of measurement noise exhibited by real-life sensors. Since FSM does not
rely on correspondences or features, and may operate under missing range
information, it is also suitable for unstructured and outdoor environments.

Future work will focus on extension to 3D LIDAR sensors, where the slices not
parallel to the ground may provide vertical motion information according to
the sine of each slice's pitch angle, and tests on more diverse environments,
such as those with high-frequency components.

The C++ code of the
proposed method, along with the implementation of the conducted experiments is
