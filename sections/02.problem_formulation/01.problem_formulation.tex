\begin{problem}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let a mobile robot, capable of motion in the $x-y$ plane, be equipped with a
  coplanarly mounted range scan sensor emitting $N_s$ rays. Let
  also the following be available or standing:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The angular range of the range sensor is $360^\circ$
    \item A 2D range scan $\mathcal{S}_0$, captured at time $t_0$
    \item A 2D range scan $\mathcal{S}_1$, captured at $t_1 \geq t_0$
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}
Then the objective is estimating the 3D rigid-body transformation
$\bm{T} = (\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta \theta)$ which, when applied to the
endpoints of $\mathcal{S}_1$, aligns them to those of $\mathcal{S}_0$ with the
least error. Equivalently, roto-translation $\bm{T}$ corresponds to the
relative motion of the sensor from the pose where it captured $\mathcal{S}_0$
to the pose from which it captured $\mathcal{S}_1$.
